            <h4>⚠️ Legal Disclaimer</h4>
            <p>
                This content is for <strong>educational purposes only</strong>. For specific legal disputes, 
                consult Consumer Protection, the Commerce Commission, or a lawyer. The Disputes Tribunal

            <h2>Your Key Consumer Rights</h2>
            <p>
                New Zealand has strong consumer protection laws. The two most important are:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Consumer Guarantees Act 1993 (CGA)</strong> — Guarantees about goods and services</li>
                <li><strong>Fair Trading Act 1986 (FTA)</strong> — Prohibits misleading conduct and unfair practices</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                <strong>Key point:</strong> These rights cannot be contracted away. Even if a business's terms 
                and conditions say otherwise, your statutory rights remain. "No refunds" signs don't override the law.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section class="content-section">
            <h2>Consumer Guarantees Act</h2>
            <p>
                The CGA provides automatic guarantees when you buy goods or services from a business. 
                These apply to transactions between consumers and businesses (not private sales).
            </p>

            <h3>Guarantees for Goods</h3>
            <p>Products you buy must:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Be of acceptable quality</strong> — Safe, durable, free from defects, acceptable in appearance</li>
                <li><strong>Be fit for purpose</strong> — Work for normal use and any specific purpose you told the seller</li>
                <li><strong>Match the description</strong> — Be as described in advertising, packaging, or by salesperson</li>
                <li><strong>Match the sample</strong> — Be the same as any sample or demo you were shown</li>
                <li><strong>Be a reasonable price</strong> — If no price was agreed beforehand</li>
                <li><strong>Have spare parts and repair facilities available</strong> — For a reasonable time</li>
                <li><strong>Come with clear ownership</strong> — You get proper title to the goods</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="info-box">
                <h4>💡 "Acceptable Quality" — What Does It Mean?</h4>
                <p>
                    A reasonable consumer would consider the product acceptable, considering: price, description, 
                    statements by the seller/manufacturer, and nature of the goods. A $20 appliance has different 
                    expectations than a $2,000 one. A second-hand item has different expectations than new.
                </p>
            </div>

            <h3>Guarantees for Services</h3>
            <p>Services must be:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Carried out with reasonable care and skill</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Fit for purpose</strong> — Achieve any particular result you specified</li>
                <li><strong>Completed in reasonable time</strong> — If no time was agreed</li>
                <li><strong>At a reasonable price</strong> — If no price was agreed</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="content-section">
            <h2>Your Remedies When Things Go Wrong</h2>
            <p>
                If a product or service fails to meet the guarantees, you have rights to a remedy. 
                The remedy depends on whether the failure is <strong>minor</strong> or <strong>major</strong>.
            </p>

            <h3>Minor Failures (Goods)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The seller can choose to: repair, replace, or refund</li>
                <li>They must do so within a reasonable time</li>
                <li>If they can't or won't fix it, it becomes a major failure</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Major Failures (Goods)</h3>
            <p>A failure is major if:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A reasonable consumer wouldn't have bought it if they'd known about the problem</li>
                <li>The goods are significantly different from description/sample</li>
                <li>The goods are substantially unfit for purpose and can't easily be fixed</li>
                <li>The goods are unsafe</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>You choose:</strong> rejection and full refund, OR replacement of equal value, OR keep the goods and get compensation for the drop in value.</p>

            <h3>For Services</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Minor failure:</strong> Supplier must fix the problem within reasonable time</li>
                <li><strong>Major failure:</strong> You can cancel the contract and get a refund for work not yet done</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="info-box">
                <h4>💡 Important: Manufacturer's Warranty vs CGA</h4>
                <p>
                    A manufacturer's warranty is <em>in addition to</em> your CGA rights, not instead of them. 
                    If a $1,000 appliance has a 1-year warranty but fails after 18 months, you may still have 
                    CGA rights — a reasonable consumer would expect such a product to last longer.
                </p>
            </div>
        </section>

        <section class="content-section">
            <h2>Fair Trading Act</h2>
            <p>
                The Fair Trading Act protects you from misleading and deceptive conduct by businesses.
            </p>

            <h3>Prohibited Conduct</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Misleading or deceptive conduct</strong> — False or misleading claims about products or services</li>
                <li><strong>False representations</strong> — Lying about quality, price, sponsorship, history, etc.</li>
                <li><strong>Bait advertising</strong> — Advertising a product at a low price without reasonable stock</li>
                <li><strong>Pyramid schemes</strong> — Schemes that pay returns mainly from new participants</li>
                <li><strong>Unfair contract terms</strong> — Terms that create significant imbalance in standard form contracts</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Price Displays</h3>
            <p>
                Prices must include GST (for consumer sales). The displayed price must be the full price 
                you'll pay. Hidden fees that are added later can breach the Fair Trading Act.

            <div class="topic-grid">
                <div class="topic-card">
                    <h4>❌ "No refunds on sale items"</h4>
                    <p><strong>Wrong.</strong> CGA rights apply to sale items. You can't waive your rights just because something was discounted.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="topic-card">
                    <h4>❌ "You need the receipt"</h4>
                    <p><strong>Not always.</strong> Proof of purchase helps, but bank statements, credit card records, or even a witness can work.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="topic-card">
                    <h4>❌ "You only have 30 days"</h4>
                    <p><strong>Wrong.</strong> There's no fixed time limit. Faults must be raised within a reasonable time, which depends on the product.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="topic-card">
                    <h4>❌ "It's out of warranty"</h4>
                    <p><strong>CGA rights continue.</strong> Warranties are extra; your statutory rights last as long as a reasonable consumer would expect.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="topic-card">
                    <h4>❌ "Take it up with manufacturer"</h4>
                    <p><strong>No.</strong> The seller is responsible to you. They can deal with the manufacturer themselves.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="topic-card">
                    <h4>❌ "Store credit only"</h4>
                    <p><strong>For major failures, no.</strong> You're entitled to choose a full refund, not just store credit.</p>

            <h2>How to Resolve Disputes</h2>

            <h3>Step 1: Contact the Business</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Explain the problem calmly and clearly</li>
                <li>State what remedy you want (repair, replacement, refund)</li>
                <li>Reference your rights under the Consumer Guarantees Act</li>
                <li>Keep records of all communications</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Step 2: Escalate if Needed</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Ask to speak to a manager</li>
                <li>Put your complaint in writing</li>
                <li>Set a reasonable deadline for response</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Step 3: External Help</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Consumer Protection</strong> — Free advice and may investigate serious breaches</li>
                <li><strong>Disputes Tribunal</strong> — For claims up to $30,000, informal, no lawyers</li>
                <li><strong>Commerce Commission</strong> — For Fair Trading Act breaches</li>
                <li><strong>Industry schemes</strong> — Some industries have their own dispute resolution (banking, insurance, utilities)</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="info-box">
                <h4>💡 The Disputes Tribunal</h4>
                <p>
                    The Disputes Tribunal is designed to be accessible. You don't need a lawyer (they're not allowed), 
                    the process is informal, and decisions are legally binding. It costs $45-$90 to file a claim. 
                    It's one of the best tools consumers have.
                </p>
            </div>
        </section>

        <section class="content-section">
            <h2>The Commerce Commission</h2>
            <p>
                The Commerce Commission enforces competition and consumer law in New Zealand. They:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Investigate breaches of the Fair Trading Act</li>
                <li>Take action against businesses that break the law</li>
                <li>Provide guidance on consumer rights</li>
                <li>Monitor markets for anti-competitive behaviour</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                While they don't resolve individual disputes, reporting issues helps them identify patterns 
                and take enforcement action against businesses that repeatedly break the law.
