                Financial literacy is power. Understanding economics helps you make better decisions about 
                money, see through political spin, and understand the forces that shape your life. This 
                knowledge shouldn't be locked behind university paywalls.

        <section class="content-section">
            <h2>Basic Economic Concepts</h2>
            
            <h3>Supply and Demand</h3>
            <p>
                The foundation of economics. When something is scarce and wanted, prices go up. When something 
                is abundant or unwanted, prices go down. This simple principle explains most market behaviour.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Demand</strong> — How much people want to buy at various prices</li>
                <li><strong>Supply</strong> — How much producers are willing to sell at various prices</li>
                <li><strong>Equilibrium</strong> — The price where supply equals demand</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Inflation</h3>
            <p>
                When the general price level rises over time, your money buys less. The Reserve Bank of NZ 
                targets inflation of 1-3% per year. Understanding inflation helps you:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Understand why wages need to keep rising just to maintain living standards</li>
                <li>See why holding cash long-term loses value</li>
                <li>Understand interest rate decisions</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="info-box">
                <h4>💡 Real vs Nominal</h4>
                <p>
                    "Nominal" means the face value of money. "Real" means adjusted for inflation. 
                    If your wages go up 3% but inflation is 5%, your <em>real</em> income has fallen 2%. 
                    Always think in real terms.
                </p>
            </div>

            <h3>Interest Rates</h3>
            <p>
                Interest is the cost of borrowing money (or the reward for saving). The Reserve Bank sets 
                the Official Cash Rate (OCR), which influences all other interest rates in the economy.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Higher rates</strong> → More expensive to borrow, more rewarding to save, economy slows</li>
                <li><strong>Lower rates</strong> → Cheaper to borrow, less reward for saving, economy stimulated</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="content-section">
            <h2>Understanding KiwiSaver</h2>
            <p>
                KiwiSaver is New Zealand's retirement savings scheme. Understanding it properly can mean 
                tens of thousands of dollars difference in your retirement.
            </p>

            <h3>How It Works</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>You contribute a percentage of your salary (3%, 4%, 6%, 8%, or 10%)</li>
                <li>Your employer must contribute at least 3%</li>
                <li>The government contributes up to $521.43 per year (member tax credit)</li>
                <li>Your money is invested and grows over time</li>
                <li>You can access it at 65, for your first home, or in hardship</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Fund Types</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Defensive/Conservative</strong> — Lower risk, lower expected returns</li>
                <li><strong>Balanced</strong> — Medium risk and returns</li>
                <li><strong>Growth</strong> — Higher risk, higher expected returns over long term</li>
                <li><strong>Aggressive</strong> — Highest risk and potential returns</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="info-box">
                <h4>💡 Key Insight: Time Horizon</h4>
                <p>
                    If you're young with decades until retirement, a growth fund typically makes sense 
                    despite short-term volatility. The power of compound returns over 30+ years is enormous. 
                    If you're near retirement, a conservative fund protects your savings.
                </p>
            </div>

            <h3>Fees Matter</h3>
            <p>
                Small differences in fees compound into large differences over decades. A 1% higher fee 
                could cost you tens of thousands over your lifetime. Compare fees between providers.

            <h2>The NZ Housing Market</h2>
            <p>
                Housing is one of the most economically significant issues facing New Zealanders. 
                Understanding the economics helps you make better decisions and see through political rhetoric.
            </p>

            <h3>Why Are NZ House Prices So High?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Supply constraints</strong> — Zoning laws, consenting costs, and construction delays limit supply</li>
                <li><strong>Low interest rates</strong> — Cheap borrowing increases buying power (recent history)</li>
                <li><strong>Population growth</strong> — Immigration and natural growth increase demand</li>
                <li><strong>Tax advantages</strong> — No capital gains tax on most property sales</li>
                <li><strong>Speculation</strong> — Property seen as investment, not just housing</li>
                <li><strong>Land banking</strong> — Developers holding land waiting for prices to rise</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Mortgage Basics</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Principal</strong> — The amount you borrow</li>
                <li><strong>Interest</strong> — The cost of borrowing</li>
                <li><strong>LVR (Loan-to-Value Ratio)</strong> — How much you borrow vs. property value</li>
                <li><strong>Fixed vs Floating</strong> — Fixed rates are locked in; floating rates move with market</li>
                <li><strong>Term</strong> — How long to repay (longer = lower payments but more interest total)</li>
            </ul>

        <section class="content-section">
            <h2>Common Financial Pitfalls</h2>
            <p>
                Understanding these common traps can save you thousands:
            </p>

            <h3>High-Interest Debt</h3>
            <p>
                Credit cards (15-25% interest), payday loans (can exceed 300% APR), and buy-now-pay-later 
                schemes can trap you in expensive debt. Always know your interest rate.
            </p>

            <h3>Lifestyle Inflation</h3>
            <p>
                As income rises, spending rises to match. Building wealth requires keeping spending 
                below income, regardless of how much you earn.
            </p>

            <h3>Not Understanding Compound Interest</h3>
            <p>
                Compound interest works for or against you. Starting to save early, even small amounts, 
                makes an enormous difference over decades. Conversely, debt that compounds grows faster 
                than most people expect.
            </p>

            <h3>Fee Blindness</h3>
            <p>
                Small fees on investments, bank accounts, and financial products add up significantly 
                over time. Always compare fee structures.
            </p>
