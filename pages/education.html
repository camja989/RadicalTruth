                Education is often presented as the only path to success — but at what cost? This section 
                helps you navigate NZ's education system, understand your options, and make informed decisions 
                about learning pathways that suit your goals and circumstances.

            <h4>⚠️ Disclaimer</h4>
            <p>
                Education policies and funding change frequently. Always verify current information 
                with official sources like the Ministry of Education, NZQA, and StudyLink.

            <h2>The Education Information Problem</h2>
            <p>
                Universities and education providers are also businesses. They have marketing departments 
                whose job is to get you enrolled. This creates information asymmetry — they know things 
                about job outcomes, completion rates, and value for money that you don't.
            </p>
            <p>
                Questions you should ask that aren't always easy to find answers to:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>What are the actual employment outcomes for this qualification?</li>
                <li>What's the salary range for graduates?</li>
                <li>Could I get this job without this qualification?</li>
                <li>What's the completion rate for this programme?</li>
                <li>Are there faster, cheaper alternatives?</li>
                <li>Is this qualification actually required, or just preferred?</li>

            <h2>NZ Education Pathways</h2>
            
            <h3>Universities (8 in NZ)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>What:</strong> Research-focused institutions offering degrees (bachelor's, master's, PhD)</li>
                <li><strong>Duration:</strong> Typically 3-4 years for bachelor's, 1-2 for master's</li>
                <li><strong>Best for:</strong> Professions requiring degrees (medicine, law, engineering), research, academia</li>
                <li><strong>Consider:</strong> High cost, not always necessary for your career goals</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Te Pūkenga (Polytechnics/ITPs)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>What:</strong> Practical, vocational education — certificates, diplomas, some degrees</li>
                <li><strong>Duration:</strong> 6 months to 3 years depending on qualification</li>
                <li><strong>Best for:</strong> Practical careers, trades, applied skills</li>
                <li><strong>Consider:</strong> Often leads to employment faster than university</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Apprenticeships</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>What:</strong> Learn while you earn — work for an employer while getting qualified</li>
                <li><strong>Duration:</strong> Typically 3-4 years</li>
                <li><strong>Best for:</strong> Trades (electrical, plumbing, carpentry, etc.)</li>
                <li><strong>Consider:</strong> You get paid while learning, finish debt-free with a qualification</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Private Training Establishments (PTEs)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>What:</strong> Private providers offering various qualifications</li>
                <li><strong>Caution:</strong> Quality varies significantly — check NZQA registration carefully</li>
                <li><strong>Consider:</strong> Some are excellent, some are degree mills — research thoroughly</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="content-section">
            <h2>The Real Cost of Education</h2>
            <p>
                When deciding on education, consider the full picture:
            </p>

            <h3>Direct Costs</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Fees:</strong> $5,000-$40,000+ per year depending on programme</li>
                <li><strong>Materials:</strong> Books, equipment, software</li>
                <li><strong>Living costs:</strong> If you can't work full-time while studying</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Opportunity Costs</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Lost income:</strong> What could you earn if working instead?</li>
                <li><strong>Lost experience:</strong> 3-4 years of workplace experience has value</li>
                <li><strong>Delayed career:</strong> Starting your career later affects lifetime earnings</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Student Loan Reality</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Interest-free while in NZ, but repayment is 12% of income over threshold</li>
                <li>Average student debt is ~$23,000, but can be much higher</li>
                <li>Takes many years to repay — affects your ability to save for a house</li>
                <li>Interest applies if you move overseas</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="info-box">
                <h4>💡 Fees-Free Eligibility</h4>
                <p>
                    First-time tertiary students get one year of fees-free study (or two years for some 
                    Level 3+ certificates). This applies to universities, polytechnics, and some PTEs. 
                    Check your eligibility carefully — it's a significant benefit.
                </p>

        <section class="content-section">
            <h2>Do You Actually Need That Degree?</h2>
            <p>
                For some careers, specific qualifications are legally required. For many others, they're 
                preferred but not essential. Here's a rough guide:
            </p>

            <h3>Qualification Usually Required</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Medicine, nursing, dentistry (health professions)</li>
                <li>Law (need law degree + professional admission)</li>
                <li>Engineering (for chartered status)</li>
                <li>Teaching (registered teacher requirements)</li>
                <li>Architecture (registration requirements)</li>
                <li>Accounting (for chartered accountant status)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Qualification Helpful But Not Always Essential</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Business/Management — experience often valued equally</li>
                <li>Marketing/Communications — portfolio matters more</li>
                <li>IT/Software — skills and portfolio can matter more than degrees</li>
                <li>Creative fields — talent and portfolio are key</li>
                <li>Many technical roles — certifications can replace degrees</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Questions to Ask</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Look at job listings in your target field — what do they actually require?</li>
                <li>Talk to people working in the field — how did they get there?</li>
                <li>Is there a pathway from entry-level to where you want to be?</li>
                <li>Could industry certifications replace a degree?</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="content-section">
            <h2>Free and Alternative Learning</h2>
            <p>
                Not all valuable learning comes from paid institutions. The internet has democratised 
                access to knowledge in remarkable ways.
            </p>

            <h3>Free Online Resources</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Khan Academy</strong> — Free courses in maths, science, economics, and more</li>
                <li><strong>MIT OpenCourseWare</strong> — Free university-level courses from MIT</li>
                <li><strong>Coursera / edX</strong> — Free to audit courses from top universities</li>
                <li><strong>YouTube</strong> — Endless educational content on virtually any topic</li>
                <li><strong>Libraries</strong> — Free access to books, databases, and online resources</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Industry Certifications</h3>
            <p>
                In many fields, industry certifications can be more valuable than degrees:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>IT:</strong> AWS, Google Cloud, Microsoft, CompTIA certifications</li>
                <li><strong>Project Management:</strong> PMP, PRINCE2</li>
                <li><strong>Finance:</strong> CFA, various accounting qualifications</li>
                <li><strong>Trade certifications:</strong> Often required for specific work</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Self-Directed Learning</h3>
            <p>
                With discipline and a plan, you can learn many skills without formal education:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Programming and software development</li>
                <li>Graphic design and digital arts</li>
                <li>Digital marketing and SEO</li>
                <li>Writing and content creation</li>
                <li>Data analysis</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="info-box">
                <h4>💡 Building a Portfolio</h4>
                <p>
                    In many fields, showing what you can do matters more than certificates saying 
                    what you studied. Build projects, contribute to open source, create content, 
                    do freelance work — these demonstrate real skills to employers.
                </p>
            </div>

        <section class="content-section">
            <h2>Trades: An Undervalued Path</h2>
            <p>
                New Zealand has a shortage of skilled tradespeople, yet trades are often presented as 
                "lesser" than university. The reality is different:
            </p>

            <h3>Advantages of Trades</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Earn while you learn</strong> — Apprentices get paid</li>
                <li><strong>No student debt</strong> — Often finish with savings, not debt</li>
                <li><strong>High demand</strong> — Shortage of tradespeople means good job security</li>
                <li><strong>Good income</strong> — Experienced tradespeople often earn more than graduates</li>
                <li><strong>Self-employment</strong> — Easier path to running your own business</li>
                <li><strong>Portable skills</strong> — Trades qualifications often transfer overseas</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Trades in Demand</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Electricians</li>
                <li>Plumbers, gasfitters, drainlayers</li>
                <li>Builders and carpenters</li>
                <li>Automotive technicians</li>
                <li>HVAC technicians</li>
                <li>Heavy vehicle technicians</li>
